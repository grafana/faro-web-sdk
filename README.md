Faro is a SDK that can instrument frontend JavaScript applications to collect
telemetry and forward it to the [Grafana Agent](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/)
(with app agent receiver integration enabled).
Grafana Agent can then send this data to
[Loki](https://grafana.com/logs/), or [Tempo](https://grafana.com/traces/).

The repository consists of multiple packages that can be combined depending on your requirements,
as well as a [demo](https://github.com/grafana/faro-web-sdk/tree/main/demo),
which can be run by following the [README.md file](https://github.com/grafana/faro-web-sdk/tree/main/demo/README.md).
