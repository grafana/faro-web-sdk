# Grafana JavaScript Agent

[![Build Status](https://drone.grafana.net/api/badges/grafana/grafana-javascript-agent/status.svg)](https://drone.grafana.net/grafana/grafana-javascript-agent)

_Warning_
This feature is currently pre-release and subject to frequent breaking changes.

Grafana JavaScript Agent is a library that can instrument frontend JavaScript applications to collect
telemetry and forward it to the [Grafana Agent](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/)
(with app agent receiver integration enabled). We are also planning to implement this for backend JavaScript applications.
Grafana Agent can then send this data to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/),
[Loki](https://grafana.com/logs/), or [Tempo](https://grafana.com/traces/).

The repository consists of multiple packages that can be combined depending on your requirements,
as well as a [demo](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-javascript-agent/tree/main/demo),
which can be run by following the [README.md file](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-javascript-agent/tree/main/demo/README.md).
