# Grafana Faro Web SDK

[![Build Status][faro-drone-status]][faro-drone]

<p align="left"><img src="docs/faro_logo.png" alt="Grafana Faro logo" width="400"></p>

The Grafana Faro Web SDK can instrument frontend JavaScript applications to collect telemetry and forward it to the
[Grafana Alloy][grafana-alloy-docs] (with faro receiver integration enabled), to a Grafana Cloud instance or to a
custom receiver. Grafana Alloy can then send this data to [Loki][grafana-logs] or [Tempo][grafana-traces].

The repository consists of multiple packages that can be combined depending on your requirements, as well as a
[demo][faro-demo], which can be run by following the [README.md file][faro-demo-readme].

## Get started

## Releases

Faro releases follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) naming scheme: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- `MAJOR`: Major releases include large new features which will significantly change how Faro operates
  and possible backwards-compatibility breaking changes.
- `MINOR`: these releases include _new features which generally do not break_ backwards-compatibility.
- `PATCH`: patch releases include _bug and security fixes_ which do not break backwards-compatibility.

  > NOTE: Our goal is to provide regular releases that are as stable as possible,
  > and we take backwards-compatibility seriously. As with any software, always read the release notes
  > and the upgrade guide whenever choosing a new version of Faro to install.

## Supported Node versions

Faro supports all active LTS (Long Term Support) and current Node versions. When Node.js versions
reach end-of-life, we remove them from our test matrix and add new versions as they are released.
You can find a [release schedule on nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases#looking-for-the-latest-release-of-a-version-branch)
