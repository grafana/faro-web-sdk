  the previous route or view (`from*`) and the destination route or view (`to*`) (#397).

- Added `agent.api.pushEvent` method for capturing RUM events.
- `FetchTransport` will back off after receiving 429 Too Many Requests response. Events will be dropped during backoff period.
  Backoff period respects `Retry-After` header if present.

  ES6 with ECMAScript modules.
