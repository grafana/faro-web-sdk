// TODO: Android build is currently not working due to Yarn workspace path resolution issues.

// expects them in the demo's local node_modules. The gradle-plugin path has been fixed
// below, but codegen still fails. Native Android code in packages/react-native/android/
// is complete and ready to work once gradle workspace configuration is resolved.
